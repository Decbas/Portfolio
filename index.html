        <h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project includes a planning phase, development phase and the technology used and not used in the process to design and create a gorilla prototype with ball joints attached, the budget for this project was £150 which is £50 per person as this is a group of three. The purpose of this project is to create a functioning prototype of a figure of a gorilla, the team have also included additional aspects to improve its functionality with future developments in mind. </p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="major">Planning</h2>
            <p>In this Planning Phase, the team design and create a gorilla Prototype ready for development. The gorilla will be based on an action figure that will be scanned and printed using various resources available. Various tools will be used such as 3D scanning, Blender for editing. To enhance the figure's mobility, the plan is to incorporate circular ball joints into the arms this will allow the arms to move freely.</p>
            <p>The concept includes adding fur to parts of the gorilla that typically have hair on a real gorilla, simulating the animal's appearance authentically. They intend to dye the gorilla's hair black while leaving the chest hairless to simulate the natural characteristics of a gorilla, The plan is to use fur, and they dye it black before sticking it on the gorilla with glue.</p>
            <p>During the development stage, the team will employ a 3D printer to produce their project in separate pieces. They plan to print two arms and then remainder of the body as one unit. The main material that will be used is PLA (Polylactic Acid) (Padzi1 et al., 2017) for printing. The reason for this choice is that it is good for 3D printing and is biodegradable, which is environmentally friendly, as it is made from non-finite resources such as corn starch and sugar cain. (Taib et al., 2022).</p>
            <p>PLA is a widely used for 3D printing due to its ease of 3D printing, it may not be as strong as some other materials that are used for printing such as ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), but it is still a fairly strong material that is suitable for small 3D printed designs such as prototype of gorilla statues. PLA is a cheap, renewable but it has a lower printing temperature which can cause morphing during printing.</p>
            <p>Sandpaper may be required for the ball joints on the torso of the gorilla so that the arms can have a socket that can just clipped on, if the printed torsos ball joints are too large it may result in the arms being unable to equipped to the torso, so it may be required to use sandpaper to sand it down. Sandpaper is used in most physical projects when trying to remove rough edges or even using it to decrease the size, a little sandpaper can be very helpful.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Use fur.</li>

                                        <h3 class="major">3D scanning hardware, software, and workshop facilities </h3>
                                        <p>A wide range of technologies were employed to implement this design, including the use of a 3D scanning gun, specifically the Handy Scan 3D VX. This scanner enables the capture of an object's entirety, which can then be uploaded to digital software for further processing (Bosche et al., 2011). The original gorilla model's structure and vertices were scanned to ensure comprehensive coverage. The resulting scanned gorilla was then viewed in scanning software, VX Elements, to confirm that all angles were captured without any missing sections. To achieve this, the gorilla needed to be scanned while lying down on each side. This approach was chosen to ensure an accurate representation of the gorilla before any modifications were made to suit the project's specifications. 3D scanning is widely used across various fields such as manufacturing and engineering. Engineers utilize this technology to create prototypes of large projects, ensuring correct measurements, compatibility, and functionality at a relatively low cost. Additionally, architects use 3D scanning tools to scan existing structures, facilitating the creation of models for future construction work (Javaid, 2021). Considering its versatility and benefits, 3D scanning is a technology worth considering for future projects if access to a scanner is available.</p>
                                        
                                        <h3 class="major">3D Modelling software - Blender </h3>
                                        <p>Using Blender for editing the gorilla's body parts proved to be effective due to the wide range of tools available within the software. Blender is a widely used free open-source 3D graphics software tool that offers various applications such as visual effects, animation for films, motion graphics, and 3D printing models. Its extensive features played a crucial role in designing the gorilla and facilitating robust changes that had a positive impact on the project. Blender was chosen primarily for its ease of use and effectiveness (Flavell, 2010). It is a widely used software for 3D modelling across various industries worldwide, including game development, films, visual effects, and 3D printing. The benefits of using Blender include its cost-effectiveness, regular updates, and maintenance. Most importantly, Blender is a versatile software that applies to a wide range of project specifications.</p>
                                        <h3 class="major">3D Printing</h3>
                                        <p>3D printing allows the user to take the graphical design from blender into and physical object that has been printed in the chosen material. By using 3D printing it can show you your design first hand and allow for further development if necessary. The team used the 3D printer to print several parts of their project such as the arms and the body. There are several different materials that can be used for printing, but some may take longer than others along with the specific nature of each project the design may fluctuate depending on the requirements of project. A primary use of 3D printing is for creating prototypes, prototypes allow the team to understand the potential of there project or even to create their project. Prototypes are a good way to ensure that the project will meet the required specification based on a small cheap version of the project. 3D printing offers to the users a wide variety of materials to create projects and prototypes such as various metals such as aluminium and plastics like nylon each with a own specific benefits and drawbacks, research into materials cost and use cases is beneficial before picking what you are using for your project (Tay et al, 2017).</p>
