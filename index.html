                                        <p> In this project, the plan is to design and create a gorilla Prototype. The gorilla will be based on an action figure that will be scanned and printed using various resources available. Various tools will be used such as 3D scanning, Blender for editing. To enhance the figure's mobility, the plan is to incorporate circular ball joints into the arms this will allow the arms to move freely.
The concept includes adding fur to parts of the gorilla that typically have hair on a real gorilla, simulating the animal's appearance authentically. They intend to dye the gorilla's hair black while leaving the chest hairless to simulate natural characteristics, The plan is to use, and they dye it black before sticking it on the gorilla with glue.
During the development stage, the team will employ a 3D printer to produce their project in separate pieces. They plan is to print two arms and the remainder of the body as one unit. The main material that will be used is PLA (Polylactic Acid) for printing. The reason for this choice is that it is good for 3D scanning and is biodegradable, which is environmentally friendly, as it is made from non-finite resources such as corn starch and sugar cain. (Taib et al., 2022).
PLA is Widley used for 3D printing due to its ease of 3D printing, it may not be a strong as some other materials that are used for printing such as ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), but it is still a fairly strong material that is suitable for small 3D printed designs such as prototype gorilla statue. PLA is a cheap, renewable and has a lower printing temperature which prevents morphing during printing.
Sandpaper may be required for the ball joints on the torso of the gorilla so that the arms can have a socket that the can just clip on, if the printed torsos ball joints are too large it may result in the arms being unable to equipped to the torso, so it may be required to use sandpaper to sand it down. Sandpaper is used in most physical project when trying to remove rough edges or even using it to decrease the size a little sandpaper can be very helpful.
Must Have 
•	Use fur.
•	Full model of the gorilla 
•	Ball joints to allow mobility in the arms.
Should have. 
•	Printed artefact
•	Connectable body parts such as arms
Could have 
•	Mobility in the neck
•	Mobility in the legs
•	Able to Disconnect limbs.
Technologies used.
3D scanning hardware, software, and workshop facilities 
A wide range of technologies are used to help implement this design, using the 3D scanning gun, handy scan 3d VX, to scan all the structure and vertices of the original gorilla model allowed for the implementation of the scanned model, this was then viewed in the scanning software, vx elements to ensure all the angels were covered and the was sections of the gorilla missing. The gorilla needed to be scanned whilst it was on each side lying down, by doing this the team was able to capture the entire gorilla. The reason it was done like this was to get an accurate representation of a gorilla before using making changes that suit the specification.
