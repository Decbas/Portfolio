        <h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project includes a planning phase, development phase and the technology used and not used in the process to design and create a gorilla prototype with ball joints attached, the budget for this project was £150 which is £50 per person as this is a group of three. The purpose of this project is to create a functioning prototype of a figure of a gorilla, the team have also included additional aspects to improve its functionality with future developments in mind. </p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="major">Planning</h2>
            <p>In this Planning Phase, the team design and create a gorilla Prototype ready for development. The gorilla will be based on an action figure that will be scanned and printed using various resources available. Various tools will be used such as 3D scanning, Blender for editing. To enhance the figure's mobility, the plan is to incorporate circular ball joints into the arms this will allow the arms to move freely.</p>
            <p>The concept includes adding fur to parts of the gorilla that typically have hair on a real gorilla, simulating the animal's appearance authentically. They intend to dye the gorilla's hair black while leaving the chest hairless to simulate the natural characteristics of a gorilla, The plan is to use fur, and they dye it black before sticking it on the gorilla with glue.</p>
            <p>During the development stage, the team will employ a 3D printer to produce their project in separate pieces. They plan to print two arms and then remainder of the body as one unit. The main material that will be used is PLA (Polylactic Acid) (Padzi1 et al., 2017) for printing. The reason for this choice is that it is good for 3D printing and is biodegradable, which is environmentally friendly, as it is made from non-finite resources such as corn starch and sugar cain. (Taib et al., 2022).</p>
            <p>PLA is a widely used for 3D printing due to its ease of 3D printing, it may not be as strong as some other materials that are used for printing such as ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), but it is still a fairly strong material that is suitable for small 3D printed designs such as prototype of gorilla statues. PLA is a cheap, renewable but it has a lower printing temperature which can cause morphing during printing.</p>
            <p>Sandpaper may be required for the ball joints on the torso of the gorilla so that the arms can have a socket that can just clipped on, if the printed torsos ball joints are too large it may result in the arms being unable to equipped to the torso, so it may be required to use sandpaper to sand it down. Sandpaper is used in most physical projects when trying to remove rough edges or even using it to decrease the size, a little sandpaper can be very helpful.</p>

                                        <h3 class="major">3D scanning hardware, software, and workshop facilities </h3>
                                        <p>A wide range of technologies were employed to implement this design, including the use of a 3D scanning gun, specifically the Handy Scan 3D VX. This scanner enables the capture of an object's entirety, which can then be uploaded to digital software for further processing (Bosche et al., 2011). The original gorilla model's structure and vertices were scanned to ensure comprehensive coverage. The resulting scanned gorilla was then viewed in scanning software, VX Elements, to confirm that all angles were captured without any missing sections. To achieve this, the gorilla needed to be scanned while lying down on each side. This approach was chosen to ensure an accurate representation of the gorilla before any modifications were made to suit the project's specifications. 3D scanning is widely used across various fields such as manufacturing and engineering. Engineers utilize this technology to create prototypes of large projects, ensuring correct measurements, compatibility, and functionality at a relatively low cost. Additionally, architects use 3D scanning tools to scan existing structures, facilitating the creation of models for future construction work (Javaid, 2021). Considering its versatility and benefits, 3D scanning is a technology worth considering for future projects if access to a scanner is available.</p>
                                        
                                        <h3 class="major">3D Modelling software - Blender </h3>
                                        <p>Using Blender for editing the gorilla's body parts proved to be effective due to the wide range of tools available within the software. Blender is a widely used free open-source 3D graphics software tool that offers various applications such as visual effects, animation for films, motion graphics, and 3D printing models. Its extensive features played a crucial role in designing the gorilla and facilitating robust changes that had a positive impact on the project. Blender was chosen primarily for its ease of use and effectiveness (Flavell, 2010). It is a widely used software for 3D modelling across various industries worldwide, including game development, films, visual effects, and 3D printing. The benefits of using Blender include its cost-effectiveness, regular updates, and maintenance. Most importantly, Blender is a versatile software that applies to a wide range of project specifications.</p>
                                        <h3 class="major">3D Printing</h3>
                                        <p>3D printing allows the user to take the graphical design from blender into and physical object that has been printed in the chosen material. By using 3D printing it can show you your design first hand and allow for further development if necessary. The team used the 3D printer to print several parts of their project such as the arms and the body. There are several different materials that can be used for printing, but some may take longer than others along with the specific nature of each project the design may fluctuate depending on the requirements of project. A primary use of 3D printing is for creating prototypes, prototypes allow the team to understand the potential of there project or even to create their project. Prototypes are a good way to ensure that the project will meet the required specification based on a small cheap version of the project. 3D printing offers to the users a wide variety of materials to create projects and prototypes such as various metals such as aluminium and plastics like nylon each with a own specific benefits and drawbacks, research into materials cost and use cases is beneficial before picking what you are using for your project (Tay et al, 2017).</p>

            <h2 class="major">Technologies Not Used</h2>
            
            <h3 class="major">Computer Aided Design/ Computer Aided Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>Both CAD and CAM are not being used in the project as they are not required and the methods aren’t suited for the project, CAD is computer aided design and is mostly used when dealing with rigid shapes, unlike bender which is an open source and allows you to put your visualizations into the real world. Making a gorilla in CAD isn’t effective as there is to may vertices along with faces with very fine details, 3D printing is much better suited rather than CAD/CAM. CAD/CAM go hand in hand CAM is used to create the CAD designs, which is usually used for the manufacturing of parts (Alghazzawi, 2016). This is used commonly to create prototypes for large numbers of industries such as car manufacturing companies. For example, engine parts are commonly done using the CAD/CAM equipment and methods.</p>
            
            <h3 class="major">Haptic Input Hardware and 3Ds Sculpting Software</h3>
            <p>Haptic input is valid way in creating designs and modelling especially on a project like a gorilla, but its time consuming and delicate, due to the delicate nature it doesn’t make Sens to use it when 3D Scanning is a more accurate, precises and efficient way of creating a gorilla. The 3D sculpting software is a type of software that allows you to use the Haptic input the create your designs. When haptic input and 3D sculpting are combined it provides a realistic and Accurate design of the image that the designer/artist’s needs. Using this technology, you have a direct contact with the digital environment making it effective in the design and animation industry, its often used for modelling, gaming, animations, and medical prospects (Escobar-Castillejos et al., 2016) haptic input is used in rehabilitation of injured patients as it provides sensory stimulation.</p>
            
            <h3 class="major">Motion Capture</h3>
            <p>Motion capture is a technology that allows the users movements to be captured and uploaded into an animation, this can be done with both objects and people. Opti Track Motive is a popular software tool that is designed to capture the movements of objects in real time and record them, the movements then can be later developed into whatever the developer intends. This technology wasn’t much of a beneficial option for the team unless they wanted to develop the project in their own motion. For example, doing something different with the head could of be achieved if the team used motion capture on one of the team members and then implemented a gorilla design of the motion. Motion Capture is commonly used for movies, tv Shows and games as it allows for good CGI and visual effects that are required (Menache, 2000).</p>
            
            <h3 class="major">Resin Production and Workshop Facilities</h3>
            <p>Along with several other different technology the team made the decision on whether to use resin lab should be used to test and incorporate the gorilla project effectively, and the conclusion was quicky made that it is not needed for the project. Mainly because a model was already made of the gorilla, 3D printing allows for easy and accurate prototype to be crated. If the resin lab was to be used for this project by incorporating the texture of the gorilla, before adding the fur, A rubberier type of texture would be more effective in this are as it could be used as a sleeve and be equipped easily onto the gorilla, using resin for this project would just be unnecessary. The resin lab contains a vast number of facilities such as ventilation systems, workbenches, storage, storage areas, safety equipment and mixing stations, safety is essential when working with resin as the fumes can be dangerous therefore the ventilation system are necessary along with gloves and goggles.</p>
            
            <h3 class="major">Laser Cutting Hardware Facilities</h3>
            <p>Laser cutting is used worldwide in several different industries to accurately cut materials that are usually difficult to cut by hand, manufacturers often use this with materials that cants be shaped effectively with manual equipment, it is also very effective on 2D designs (panelNaresh et al., 2021), for example cutting out scaled pieces of a hard type of metal such as steel is what its suited for. The reason this wasn’t chosen by the team was because it doesn’t have an effective use to the project compared to 3D printing, as the model was already scanned and developed in blender and 3D printers have a easier time with complex 3D Shapes.</p>
