<!-- Introduction -->
<section id="intro" class="wrapper style1">
    <div class="inner">
        <h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project includes a planning phase, development phase and the technology used and not used in the process to design and create a gorilla prototype with ball joints attached, the budget for this project was £150 which is £50 per person as this is a group of three. The purpose of this project is to create a functioning prototype of a figure of a gorilla, the team have also included additional aspects to improve its functionality with future developments in mind. </p>

<section id="planning" class="wrapper spotlight style1">
    <div class="inner">

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="major">Planning</h2>
            <p>In this Planning Phase, the team design and create a gorilla Prototype ready for development. The gorilla will be based on an action figure that will be scanned and printed using various resources available. Various tools will be used such as 3D scanning, Blender for editing. To enhance the figure's mobility, the plan is to incorporate circular ball joints into the arms this will allow the arms to move freely.</p>
            <p>The concept includes adding fur to parts of the gorilla that typically have hair on a real gorilla, simulating the animal's appearance authentically. They intend to dye the gorilla's hair black while leaving the chest hairless to simulate the natural characteristics of a gorilla. The plan is to use fur, and dye it black before sticking it on the gorilla with glue.</p>
            <p>During the development stage, the team will employ a 3D printer to produce their project in separate pieces. They plan to print two arms and then the remainder of the body as one unit. The main material that will be used is PLA (Polylactic Acid) for printing. The reason for this choice is that it is good for 3D printing and is biodegradable, which is environmentally friendly, as it is made from non-finite resources such as corn starch and sugar cane. PLA is widely used for 3D printing due to its ease of use, although it may not be as strong as some other materials such as ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene). However, it is still a fairly strong material that is suitable for small 3D printed designs such as prototype gorilla statues. PLA is cheap, renewable but it has a lower printing temperature which can cause morphing during printing.</p>
            <p>Sandpaper may be required for the ball joints on the torso of the gorilla so that the arms can have a socket that can just be clipped on. If the printed torso's ball joints are too large, it may result in the arms being unable to be equipped to the torso, so it may be required to use sandpaper to sand it down. Sandpaper is commonly used in most physical projects when trying to remove rough edges or even to decrease the size, a little sandpaper can be very helpful.</p>
            <h3>Must Have</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use fur.</li>
                <li>Full model of the gorilla.</li>
                <li>Ball joints to allow mobility in the arms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Should have</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Printed artefact.</li>
                <li>Connectable body parts such as arms</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Could have</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mobility in the neck.</li>
                <li>Mobility in the legs.</li>
                <li>Able to Disconnect limbs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Wont haves</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Robotic Automatic Functionality</li>
                <li>Resin for diverse texture.</li>
                <li>Latex texture for a skin feels.</li>
            </ul>
                <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                <p>The team could of came together earlier to create a more productive plan and set better goals to push them to make the best possible artefact, with better plan in place it is defiantly possible for the team to research and test more technology that could have been beneficial to the project.</p>

            <h2 class="major">Design</h2>
            <h3 class="major">3D scanning hardware, software, and workshop facilities </h3>
            <p>A wide range of technologies were employed to implement this design, including the use of a 3D scanning gun, specifically the Handy Scan 3D VX. This scanner enables the capture of an object's entirety, which can then be uploaded to digital software for further processing (Bosche et al., 2011). The original gorilla model's structure and vertices were scanned to ensure comprehensive coverage. The resulting scanned gorilla was then viewed in scanning software, VX Elements, to confirm that all angles were captured without any missing sections. To achieve this, the gorilla needed to be scanned while lying down on each side. This approach was chosen to ensure an accurate representation of the gorilla before any modifications were made to suit the project's specifications. 3D scanning is widely used across various fields such as manufacturing and engineering. Engineers utilize this technology to create prototypes of large projects, ensuring correct measurements, compatibility, and functionality at a relatively low cost. Additionally, architects use 3D scanning tools to scan existing structures, facilitating the creation of models for future construction work (Javaid, 2021). Considering its versatility and benefits, 3D scanning is a technology worth considering for future projects if access to a scanner is available.</p>
            
            <h3 class="major">3D Modelling software - Blender </h3>
            <p>Using Blender for editing the gorilla's body parts proved to be effective due to the wide range of tools available within the software. Blender is a widely used free open-source 3D graphics software tool that offers various applications such as visual effects, animation for films, motion graphics, and 3D printing models. Its extensive features played a crucial role in designing the gorilla and facilitating robust changes that had a positive impact on the project. Blender was chosen primarily for its ease of use and effectiveness (Flavell, 2010). It is a widely used software for 3D modelling across various industries worldwide, including game development, films, visual effects, and 3D printing. The benefits of using Blender include its cost-effectiveness, regular updates, and maintenance. Most importantly, Blender is a versatile software that applies to a wide range of project specifications.</p>

            <h3 class="major">3D Printing</h3>
            <p>3D printing allows the user to take the graphical design from blender into and physical object that has been printed in the chosen material. By using 3D printing it can show you your design first hand and allow for further development if necessary. The team used the 3D printer to print several parts of their project such as the arms and the body. There are several different materials that can be used for printing, but some may take longer than others along with the specific nature of each project the design may fluctuate depending on the requirements of project. A primary use of 3D printing is for creating prototypes, prototypes allow the team to understand the potential of there project or even to create their project. Prototypes are a good way to ensure that the project will meet the required specification based on a small cheap version of the project. 3D printing offers to the users a wide variety of materials to create projects and prototypes such as various metals such as aluminium and plastics like nylon each with a own specific benefits and drawbacks, research into materials cost and use cases is beneficial before picking what you are using for your project (Tay et al, 2017).</p>

            <h2 class="major">Designing Alternatives</h2>
            <h3 class="major">Haptic input hardware and 3Ds sculpting software.</h3>
            <p>Haptic input is a valid way of creating designs and modeling, especially on a project like a gorilla, but it's time-consuming and delicate. Due to its delicate nature, it doesn’t make sense to use it when 3D Scanning is a more accurate, precise, and efficient way of creating a gorilla. The 3D sculpting software is a type of software that allows you to use the Haptic input to create your designs. When haptic input and 3D sculpting are combined, it provides a realistic and accurate design of the image that the designer/artist needs. Using this technology, you have direct contact with the digital environment, making it effective in the design and animation industry. It's often used for modeling, gaming, animations, and medical prospects (Escobar-Castillejos et al., 2016). Haptic input is used in the rehabilitation of injured patients as it provides sensory stimulation.</p>

            <h3 class="major">Motion Capture</h3>
            <p>Motion capture is a technology that allows the user's movements to be captured and uploaded into an animation; this can be done with both objects and people. Opti Track Motive is a popular software tool designed to capture the movements of objects in real-time and record them; the movements can then be later developed into whatever the developer intends. This technology wasn’t much of a beneficial option for the team unless they wanted to develop the project in their motion. For example, doing something different with the head could have been achieved if the team used motion capture on one of the team members and then implemented a gorilla design of the motion. Motion Capture is commonly used for movies, TV shows, and games as it allows for good CGI and visual effects that are required (Menache, 2000).</p>

            <h3 class="major">Computer Aided Design/ Computer Aided Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>Both CAD and CAM are not being used in the project as they are not required, and the methods aren’t suited for the project. CAD is computer-aided design and is mostly used when dealing with rigid shapes, unlike Blender which is an open-source and allows you to put your visualizations into the real world. Making a gorilla in CAD isn’t effective as there are too many vertices along with faces with very fine details; 3D printing is much better suited rather than CAD/CAM. CAD/CAM go hand in hand; CAM is used to create the CAD designs, which are usually used for the manufacturing of parts (Alghazzawi, 2016). This is commonly used to create prototypes for large numbers of industries such as car manufacturing companies. For example, engine parts are commonly done using the CAD/CAM equipment and methods.</p>

            <h3 class="major">Evaluation</h3>
            <p>The team worked together effectively to propose and consider several different possible technologies that can be used effectively. With a better understanding of various technology and completed tasks in various software, the team's progress and a good step towards the final development of the projects, the team could have tested the other design software to have a better understanding of them.</p>

<section id="four" class="wrapper alt style1">
    <div class="inner">
        <h2 class="major">Development</h2>
        <section class="features">
            <!-- Features -->
            <h3 class="major">Development Process</h3>
            <p>During the development, the team decided to use 3D scanning technology to scan the gorilla. During the scanning, a problem quickly arose which was the size and shape of the gorilla that was being scanned. Due to the gorilla statue, it couldn’t be scanned whilst standing up, it was missing piece of it whilst scanning, the gorilla was put on each side and scanned so that all vertices could be captured, with this, the next steps are able to be taken.</p>
            <p>After Scanning the gorilla, it was then exported into blender as a STL file, this allowed for the second phase of the development to begin where the team then used blender to make the required changes. The changes that were made were adding ball joints to the arms to give the figure mobility. During this process it was required</p>
            
            <h4 class="major">Body</h4>
            <p>After taking the arms off the model in blender, a few issues arose which were the fact that the blender model was all warped and has a large amount of vertices, so it became a very time consuming task to fix the unscaled hole that was left from pulling the arms off, the solution was to put a cylinder inside of the body and then all the access space around the model was pulled to the cylinders to eliminate any gaps, this was done by using the edit mode then the vertices were all pulled to connect. The way the arms were taken off was by simply highlighting the vertices in edit mode and deleting them, the reason it was done this way was simply because of how it was structured. The models arm joins overlapped with different body parts around the model so the team couldn’t use straighter and more accurate tool to slice the arm off as it would just cut vertices out of the other body parts.</p>
            
            <h4 class="major">Arms</h4>
            <p>The arms were done in a similar manner as the body, the aim was to take the arms of the body and leave the natural holes in the arms so the cylinders that are now on the body can be slotted on, the main concern with this is the shape of the hole as it is a unsymmetrical shape the holes may be too small to fit onto the body, but the team decided the best method may be to just simply sand it down by hand using sandpaper, because it’s better to have the hole to small than to big as if they were too big there wouldn’t be a way around it and it would need be reprinted.</p>
            
            <h3 class="major">Decision Making</h3>
            
            <p>Several decisions were made before and during the project development stage, the first decision was technology selection, with a wide range of tools and resources available to the team, a decision needed to be made to ensure the team uses all necessary technology, it was between 3D scanning and Haptic Input for the designs and the team thought it be best to use 3D scanning as its simpler to use and will give them a much better result. The team also decided to use blender to edit the model as it is the best option available over CAD as it offers a wide range of editing tools. Finally, 3D printing was chosen for its simple use of material and efficiency in creating a 3D prototype.</p>
            <h3 class="major">Technology</h3>
            <h4 class="major">3D Printing – Materials</h4>
            <p>There are several different printing options that are available for the prototype, due to time the team didn’t manage to print the final artefact, but everything was ready for the process, the material chosen by the team was PLA (Polylactic Acid). The reason for this choice was due to its environmentally friendly nature, its low cost and the fact that is easy to print. Other material’s that could have been used are ABS, PETG and Nylon. ABS Has a high heat resistance to prevent morphing but also requires ventilation due to the harmful fumes it emits. Another material need was fur, Faux fur was chosen due to the fact it was cheap and didn’t use real animals.</p>
            
            <h3 class="major">3D Printing - Alternatives</h3>
            <p>Resin production and workshop facilities. Along with several other different technology the team made the decision on whether to use resin lab should be used to test and incorporate the gorilla project effectively, and the conclusion was quickly made that it is not needed for the project. Mainly because a model was already made of the gorilla, 3D printing allows for easy and accurate prototype to be created. If the resin lab was to be used for this project by incorporating the texture of the gorilla, before adding the fur, A rubberier type of texture would be more effective in this are as it could be used as a sleeve and be equipped easily onto the gorilla, using resin for this project would just be unnecessary. The resin lab contains a vast number of facilities such as ventilation systems, workbenches, storage, storage areas, safety equipment and mixing stations, safety is essential when working with resin as the fumes can be dangerous therefore the ventilation system are necessary along with gloves and goggles.</p>
            
            <p>Laser cutting hardware facilities. Laser cutting is used worldwide in several different industries to accurately cut materials that are usually difficult to cut by hand, manufacturers often use this with materials that can't be shaped effectively with manual equipment, it is also very effective on 2D designs (panelNaresh et al., 2021), for example cutting out scaled pieces of a hard type of metal such as steel is what its suited for. The reason this wasn’t chosen by the team was because it doesn’t have an effective use to the project compared to 3D printing, as the model was already scanned and developed in blender and 3D printers have an easier time with complex 3D Shapes.</p>
            
            <h3 class="major">Future Development</h3>
            <p>Future Development will be taken place for a second prototype, this would contain more mobility on the figure, for example the gorilla will have a rotating neck, legs torso, ankles, and wrists. This can be done in the same fashion as the arms, by using blender to pull apart the model it can be accompanied by more than just ball joints but a peg sort attachment to allow the torso to slot onto the legs same for the head onto the neck this could also be applied to the wrists and ankles as ball joints may make them spin a full 360 degrees which will take the prototypes from limited mobility to limb and unable to stand as it won’t stand up right, so the proposal could be made to add small levers on the back of the pins to stop it spinning the full motion of 360 degrees as well.</p>
            
            <h3 class="major">Evaluation</h3>
            <p>This project of the Gorilla was a journey from start to finish, the team manages to plan, design, and develop a gorilla prototype by using various technology and software available, making crucial decisions on which technologies are beneficial to the project and why they are more important than the alternatives. The team are impressed with the process taken but would like to improve on it more with future development. The team could of came together early in the planning phase to help each other have better project development process and get artefact that has more impressive feats.</p>
